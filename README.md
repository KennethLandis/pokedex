# pokedex
Create pokedex with pokeapi

Summary:
App makes a call to the pokeapi to gather the original 151 pokemon along with image sprites and additional information.  It will then populate the page with icons
for each pokemon in the selected number.  Then the app will allow users to type in to filter out pokemon based on name or type in the search query's with an onKeyUp
button action that will call a filter function.  This creates a way to sort through the pokemon and find what they are looking for.
